enclosure
    shell
        box minus a little smaller box
            walls width, depth=width, height
        subtract connector cutouts plus fudge
            subtract a model of the board?
            some are solids for females (sticking out from board)
            some are solids for males (plugging into board)
            almost all connectors are above board
            but power connector is above board.  Put above board?
        badge space - need to design badge first?
    bosses
        upper
            1cm cylinder from board top to top of shell
            cylinder subtracted to height of soldering iron
                need soldering iron length
                Try different sizes as templates
        lower
            1cm cylinder from board bottom to bottom of shell
            cylinder subtracted across full height or whatever of screw diameter plus fudge
            cylinder subtracted from screw wall below board (1mm?) across full height size of screw head plus fudge
    buttons
        add cylinders down to button caps
        subtract spirals around cylinders to allow more easy pressing - okay if they go all the way down
        separately 3D print different color discs to glue on as buttons
    LEDs
        add cylinders down to each LED
        then subtract smaller cylinders same size for wave guide
        bonus make them the same size as plastic rod stock from TAP

lip
    needs to be parametric in width - inner lip and outer lip need to have some tolerance
    lip is on *inner* edge of shell, against board edge
    board sits on bosses enclosed by lip
    lip width = shell thickness width / 2
    lip is box, size of inner wall of shell plus half width of shell, lip height

halves of enclosure for printing
    bottom is
        shell minus everything above YX plane, bottom of board
        plus lip minus fudge
    top is shell minus everything below YX plane
        minus lip

12/19/2022 initial print thoughts tested against bare board, no through-hole
not a lot of tolerance on audio holes
    ./ -> need to enlarge
serial board
    ./ -> probably needs more room towards back
SD card
    ./ -> needs a mm or two on both sides
halves have slight warp, a little hard to join them - will help to have bosses
halves have slight dimensionality issue, maybe print one half at a time in the same place on the print bed 
hard to test without bosses
    ./ -> make bottom bosses
locations of cutouts really pretty good!  Just need minor tweaking in X and Y and additional tolerance
enclosure top and bottom are nice and smooth
I should put little rubber feet on the enclosure bottom - I wonder if I could have indentations that would print ok, same as idea for badge on top
need CPU and SDRAM heat slots
Probably need some kind of reinforcement on small bits hanging down ... ?
    ./ -> make reinforcements
Power jack
    ./ -> need lots of slop

12/20/2022 second print with bosses and buttons
bosses are too long on the top
    ./ -> make sure to subtract the board thickness, maybe minus a fudge?
    X -> subtract a fudge for the bottom bosses?
bottom boss screw holes are hairy
    ./ -> print support material
./ -> CTRL slots need a little around them
./ -> SD can be less tall
./ -> make everything on rear side except microusb be .5mm all around
./ -> add 1.5mm forward on serial board cutout
./ -> make button spring thinner and wider
./ -> make button pressor wider

12/23
./ -> Round or chamfer edges of case
./ -> Design logo
    (printed in two layers with super-thin silver base then black PLA?)
./ -> Make a recessed area for logo - make upper wall thicker?  So wall can be 3mm and recess can be 1mm, leaving 1mm of wall thickness under logo?
./ -> Make little foot indents for rubber feet
./ -> Make heat slots over CPU and memory

1/1/2023
print in black PETG
board plus bosses leaves a gap
    ./ -> remove from top boss or remove from bottom boss or maybe both?
    turned out into 
./ -> print small silver tops to glue to buttons - how to make sure they glue perfectly? One layer recess of button spring?  have X descending from button and corresponding X subtracted from button cylinder
./ -> make LED pipes bigger with a recess for white top
./ -> thin white tops for LED pipes

1/3/2023
-> probably also need to shorten button cylinders - one nearest edge while there is gap gives most satisfying click
-> shorten LED pipes - they extend to top of board

1/5/2023
Button pins are too weak / too wide and printing caused a lot of stringing
    -> need to experiment with pinhole diameters vs pins
-> LED cover recesses are not flat, more like cones
./ -> LED pipes are too tall
./ -> inner wall cannot be rounded

So prints are:
1) Top of case in center of platform in black PETG - glue stick?  How to make smooth?
2) bottom of case in center of platform in black PETG
3) logo plate using black PLA then silver PLA
4) button tops in silver PLA
5) LED tops in white PLA
