    Need to have out-of-scan 5S and C flag calculation according to sprite settings
    audio is too slow?

Weird USB fail
    works if FRACTAL.A is running *if* I'm using read_regions, write_regions, and repage_regions
        -> interaction with a softswitch and a backed region?
    It's not writes from interface.rosa.cpp; I have disabled them and USB is still hung
    connects and disconnects are still reported

is HAL_TIM_IC_MspInit being called?
    it calls __HAL_LINKDMA(htim_ic,hdma[TIM_DMA_ID_UPDATE],hdma_tim1_up);

Woz HGR mode??
    struct MemoryWriteRecord
    {
        uint64_t nanosecond;
        uint16_t address;
        uint16_t value; /* low 8 bits */
    };

    uint64_t previousNanosecond;
    MemoryWriteRecord *currentWrite;
    MemoryWriteRecord *memoryWrites;
    size_t memoryWriteCount;
    while((currentWrite - memoryWrites) < memoryWriteCount) {
        while(((currentWrite - memoryWrites) < memoryWriteCount) && (currentNanosecond() < currentWrite->nanosecond)) {
            WozHGR1Buffer[currentWrite->address - 0x2000] = currentWrite->value;
            currentWrite++;
        }
    }
